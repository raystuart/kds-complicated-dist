KDS Complicated Distribution
============================

To see if Fredric Mitchell's KDS can survive complications, like Views, Panels, and Features. :)

This will attempt to add Views, Panels, and Features while keeping things
simple. Simple in the context of Views and Panels is primarily about generated
markup. Simple in the context of Features is primarily about development
workflow and site configuration. Over all is site administration.
